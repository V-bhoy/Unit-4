 ### SIMPLE COUNTER ###
 
This is a small counter created using react js hook that is the useState function.
 
This function will basically return an array of the initial state that is the initial value and a function that will be          used to update the initial state (updates output in other words).
The initial argument passed to the useState is only used during the first render.
--->  REMEMBER TO CALL HOOKS ONLY AT THE TOP LEVEL AND FROM REACT FUNCTIONS

There are four buttons - increment, decrement, double and reset that will update the counter when you click it as per the function that the name of the particular button suggests!
